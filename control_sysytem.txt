\begin{frame}{QUESTION}
\begin{itemize}Q. The Nyquist stability criterion and the Routh criterion both are powerful analysis tools for
determining the stability of feedback controllers. Identify which of the following statements
is FALSE:
\newline
\newline(A) Both the criteria provide information relative to the stable gain range of the system.
\newline(B) The general shape of the Nyquist plot is readily obtained from the Bode magnitude plot
for all minimum-phase systems.
\newline(C) The Routh criterion is not applicable in the condition of transport lag, which can be
readily handled by the Nyquist criterion.
\newline(D) The closed-loop frequency response for a unity feedback system cannot be obtained
from the Nyquist plot. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{ANSWER}
\framesubtitle{}
\begin{itemize}
     The answer is option:(D)
     \newline
     \newline The closed-loop frequency response for a unity feedback system cannot be obtained from the Nyquist plot. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reasons for the options}

 \hspace{4mm} Option(A) Both the criteria provide information relative to the stable gain range of the system is true.
 \newline
  \newline Option(B) It's true because as in a minimum-phase system, Bode magnitude plot is enough to obtain a general
approximation of its Nyquist plot.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Reasons for the options}
    

\newline
\newline Option(C)  Routh criterion can be applied to any system to check the stability of a system but a transport lag
controller can only by explained using Nyquist Criterion.
\newline
\newline Option(D)  We can obtain closed-loop frequency response for Unity Feedback system easily by substituting s
= jω, and draw the plot for different values of ω. Usually this is not done as it is not necessary as
OLTF is enough to comment on the stability. Thus, (D) is false.
